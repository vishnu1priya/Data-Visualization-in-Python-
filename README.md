# Data-Visualization-in-Python

Data visualization is the process of creating visual representations of data to better understand and communicate information. It is a powerful tool for exploring, analyzing, and communicating complex data sets, and can help people gain insights that may be difficult to see through tables or raw numbers alone. 

The goal of data visualization is to present data in a way that is easy to interpret, engaging, and insightful. There are many different types of visualizations, including graphs, charts, maps, and infographics, and the type of visualization used depends on the type of data being analyzed and the audience it is being presented to. 

Data visualization can be used in a wide range of fields, from business and finance to science and engineering. Some common applications of data visualization include:

- Exploring and analyzing data to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies.
- Communicating complex data sets to a non-technical audience.
- Identifying and visualizing relationships between different variables or data points.
- Comparing and contrasting data from different sources or over time.
- Identifying outliers or areas of concern in large data sets.

Overall, data visualization is an essential tool for anyone working with data, as it can help to reveal insights and patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed.

Matplotlib and Seaborn are two popular data visualization libraries for Python.

Matplotlib is a versatile library for creating a wide range of visualizations, including line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, and more. It provides a low-level interface for creating custom visualizations, as well as a high-level interface for quickly generating common plot types. Matplotlib is highly customizable, allowing users to adjust every aspect of a plot's appearance, and is widely used in scientific research, engineering, and data analysis.

Seaborn, on the other hand, is a library that is built on top of Matplotlib and provides a high-level interface for creating statistical graphics. Seaborn is designed to work well with pandas data frames, making it easy to create complex visualizations that show relationships between variables or highlight patterns in data. Seaborn includes several built-in plot types, including scatter plots, line plots, bar plots, and histograms, as well as more advanced types like heat maps, pair plots, and joint plots. Seaborn also includes several color palettes that can be used to create visually appealing plots.

Overall, Matplotlib is a more general-purpose library that provides a lot of flexibility for creating custom visualizations, while Seaborn is a more specialized library that is focused on statistical graphics and makes it easy to create complex visualizations with little code. Both libraries are widely used and have active communities that provide support and resources for learning how to use them effectively.

Problem Statement:
The team at Google Play Store wants to develop a feature that would enable them to boost visibility for the most promising apps. Now, this analysis would require a preliminary understanding of the features that define a well-performing app. You can ask questions like:

Does a higher size or price necessarily mean that an app would perform better than the other apps?
Or does a higher number of installs give a clear picture of which app would have a better rating than others?
